# Text-Analyzer

Programming Assignment Unit 1

Assignment Instructions
This assignment aims to assess your skills/knowledge on basics of String creation and various string handling functions. This is a scenario based practical assignment to create a text analysis tool, providing students with a hands-on opportunity to apply their programming skills in a real-world context. The assignment focuses on developing a program that performs various operations on text input, enhancing students' skills in handling strings, data analysis, and user interaction. 


Scenario: You have been asked to create a text analysis tool that will perform various operations on a given text input. This tool will help users gain insights into the text data by performing character and word analysis.  


Assignment Tasks: 


User Input: Ask the user to input a paragraph or a lengthy text. Your program should read and store this input.  

Character Count: Calculate and display the total number of characters in the input text.  

Word Count: Calculate and display the total number of words in the input text. Assume that words are separated by spaces.  

Most Common Character: Find and display the most common character in the text. In case of a tie, select any of the tied characters.  

Character Frequency: Ask the user to input a character. Check and display the frequency of occurrences of this character in the text. Be case-insensitive (e.g., 'a' and 'A' should be considered the same character).  

Word Frequency: Ask the user to input a word. Check and display the frequency of occurrences of this word in the text. Be case-insensitive.  

Unique Words: Calculate and display the number of unique words in the text (case-insensitive).



Submission Instructions
Read the rubric on how you are going to be graded before you start to work on this assignment. 

Remember to use appropriate variable names and follow best practices of coding. Please provide a screenshot of the outputs. Submit the assignment in MS Word or PDF file.    

You will be assessed based on the following criteria:
Compilation – The code runs without any errors.

Input Validation – This ensures that the user's input meets certain criteria or constraints before it is processed further. 

Logic and Computation - This handles the core functionality and processing of the questions. 

Program flow and structure - It encompasses the overall structure and behavior of the program. 

Submission of code and screenshots of the output.

Code style and readability - Refers to the way the code is written, organized, and presented. It focuses on making the code clear, easy to understand, and maintainable.
